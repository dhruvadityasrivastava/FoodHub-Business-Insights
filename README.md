FoodHub Business Insights: An Exploratory Data Analysis
Project Overview
This project performs an in-depth exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the FoodHub dataset to uncover key insights into food delivery trends, customer ratings, and restaurant performance. The goal is to identify factors that influence order cost, delivery time, and customer satisfaction.

Data Source
The dataset used is foodhub_order.csv, containing anonymized order data from a food delivery service. Key features include restaurant name, cuisine type, order cost, day of the week, customer rating, and delivery logistics. Â  

Key Questions Explored
What are the most popular and highest-rated cuisines?

How does the cost of an order vary by cuisine and day of the week?

Is there a correlation between food preparation time, delivery time, and customer rating?

Methodology & Tools
Data Cleaning & Preprocessing: Handled missing values (e.g., 'Not given' ratings) and ensured data type consistency using Python's Pandas library.

Analysis & Visualization: Conducted statistical analysis and created visualizations using Matplotlib and Seaborn to explore relationships within the data.
